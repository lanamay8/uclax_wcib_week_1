          Hello. This is Alana. I live just west of Boston, MA. Fall is a great time of year here, as long
          as you don't think about what follows. I'm using a MacBook Pro for this class.

          Setting up the local dev environment was a little frustrating for me. Of course when you're
          doing something new and it doesn't go as planned, you typically think it's all you, that you've mucked
          up the process or somehow introduced a rogue issue that causes you to then run in circles to chase it down. So I did
          that for a couple of days. A call to Apple Support revealed that my computer had some permissions and
          paths issues. Once those were resolved I was able to proceed setting up the dev environment.
          Now things are up and running smoothly.

          Setting up the hosting environment was a breeze in comparison.
